You play as the inner party, but the events are from the outer party's predictions as to what events will help because the outer party actually runs the system, the inner party just keeps it in check the way they want it too.

*If ranges are [1, 10], then generally they do not have much to do with accomplishing event.

Description: Bombings are increasing, enemies are winning!
Ranges: ([1, 10], [20, 40], [10, 30], [5, 15],  [1, 4], [1, 10], [10, 25])
		(0,			5,		 4,		   2,		1,		0,			3)
Explanation: No reason to make people more stupid as long as people are too scared to try and fight back because they know the punishment for fighting back. The only thing you have to worry about it people being too smart to avoid the Party or group up with others. This is covered by lowering needs and more monitoring. Makes people have a common enemy, so unity should increase. Education will help children find these smart people, but too much education is needed to help these children find the smart people so it would remain smaller.

Explanation: The three-minutes hate's purpose is too scare the people into working harder and not be a bad person. They need people to be scared so they can unify people so they will work harder on things like newspeak, or not need as many basic needs,
it will also help change the past, it will also make it easier to educate the people.

Explanation: 





**Why the Party wants to control these values**
Newspeak is there to make people more stupid and have no knowledge of why the Party might need to be overthrown. It's goal is to make it easier to control the people.
Fear is used to make people to scared to cause an uprising and speak up about why the Party needs to be overthrown. 
Unity makes everyone turn into one person by having the same thought process and goals, Big Brother. That would be why population decreases.
Education makes it to where children seek out bad guys and become a part of the Party.
The Party regulates the peoples needs which can make the people either too tired to think about things, or make it easier for people to do their jobs.
The Party controls the present, which can control the past, which can also control the present.
Monitoring makes it to where people can't get away with doing anything they aren't supposed to.
